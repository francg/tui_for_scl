Tools, as well as ICT applications and the Internet itself, may facilitate higher order skills and thus mediate learning, in schools and beyond\cite{kashdan_outdoors_2013}. Indeed, Engestrom\cite{engestrom_non_1991} argues against the separation between schooling and other learning experiences; he refers to it as the encapsulation of school learning. To overcome this encapsulation, he offers emphasis on the role of mediating artifacts in human cognition and learning.
This project achieves overcoming the encapsulation of school learning by using ICT tools to mediate the environment to the students, as well as to expose the products to the community\cite{kashdan_outdoors_2013}.
