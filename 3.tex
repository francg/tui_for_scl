\subsection{Characteristics of Tangible Interfaces}
Tangible user interfaces (also called graspables, tokens, phicons, containers, hereafter referred as TUIs) denote systems that rely on ``tangible manipulation, physical representation of data and embeddedness in the real space'' [REF], allowing for an embodied interaction with digital information. Embodied interaction, as defined by Dourish [REF], is a collection of trends emerged in HCI, relying on the common ground to provide a more natural user interaction with digital information. Embodied interaction makes an enormous shift from previous paradigms (e.g. command-line or graphical user interfaces). It takes the interaction ``off the screen'' to the real world by distributing inputs and outputs in space rather than in time, desequentialising interaction and reducing the gap between where the information is created where it is accessed. In this picture, unlike Graphical User Interface (GUIs) approaches that allow for the manipulation of virtual elements (e.g. icons) with the aid of keyboard, mouse or touchscreens; TUIs seamlessly integrate both representation and control of computation into physical artefacts [REF]: ``By treating the body of the device as part of the user interface -an embodied user interface- we can go beyond the manipulation of a GUI and allow the user to really directly manipulate an integrated physical-virtual device'' [REF]. TUIs allows interaction designers to be free to experiment with new types of metaphors, taking advantages of the users' physical skills and providing interfaces which exploit people's knowledge with the everyday non-digital world [REF]. Unlike traditional ICT systems, the interactional paradigm is not one device per person. Rather, a single person interacts with a collection of devices that are orchestrated to expose coherent behaviours.
