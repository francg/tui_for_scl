In this article we proposed a new way to empower technology in smart city learning scenarios. The limitations of current technological patterns were highlighted and TUIs were introduced as a viable alternative to more traditional approaches.

Strengths and key components of TUIs were presented in connection to smart city learning issues.
TUIs can successfully address several of the challenges that characterize research and interaction in smart city learning scenarios.
