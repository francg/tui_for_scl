  abstract = {Social media and web 2.0 tools offer opportunities to devise novel participation strategies that can engage previously difficult to reach, as well as new, segments of society in urban planning. This paper examines participatory planning in the four local government areas of Brisbane City Council, Gold Coast City Council, Redland City Council and Toowoomba Regional Council, all situated in South East Queensland, Australia. The paper discusses how social media and web 2.0 tools can deliver a more engaging planning experience to citizens and investigates local government's current use and receptiveness to social media tools for plan-making and community engagement. The study's research informed the development of criteria to assess the level of participation reached through the current use of social media and web 2.0 in the four local government areas. This resulted in an adaptation of the International Association for Public Participation (IAP2) Toolbox to integrate these new tools, which is being presented to encourage further discussion and evaluation by planning professionals.},

The purpose of the adaptivity and context awareness is to better support a variety of learners, given that they may have very different skills and motivations to learn in varying contexts. The recent research on adaptivity and context awareness has turned towards supporting pervasive environments and this is coupled with the increasing trend in seeing learning environments from an informal learning perspective. In this paper are presented experiences of developing an adaptive and context aware mobile learning system, with examples of other systems underlining the development towards supporting pervasive learning environments. We then consider approaches for the future development of systems supporting pervasive learning environments.},

A consequence of this rapid development is that the pedagogy of mobile learning has yet to become clearly established. The purpose of this report is: 1.To attempt to define mobile learning in terms of a flexible model that will enable developers, tutors and learners to identify learning practices and effective pedagogies incorporated in a particular learning space. 2.To identify key elements that are unique to mobile learning, and provide initial check list indicating pedagogically useful learning activities that can be supported by the technologies. 3.To look at the current literature on the pedagogy of mobile learning and thereby assist designers in developing a user-centred approach that is driven by learner pull rather than technological push and to provide sign posts for tutoring, teaching and learning with mobile devices. In addition literature from other paradigms, such as e-learning and online communities, is included where the results are thought likely to contribute to the mobile pedagogical paradigm. 4.To begin compiling a database of guidelines which capture this expertise.

purpose devices that can be situated in a real-world setting and  are designed 
for particular collaborative contexts and uses. However this is  a new design

should look like. In this chapter, I hint at the variety of  design categories 
for collaborative physical interfaces, as suggested and  illustrated by a 
collection of working prototypes created by researchers and  students at the 
University of Calgary. We will also see that two toolkits  encouraged people to
 explore creative ideas in this new genre. Through Phidgets,  people rapidly 
prototype physical user interfaces under computer control.  Through the
Grouplab  Collabrary, people had an easy means to share data between 
interconnected  devices and software. These combined tools became a media form 
that allowed  researchers and students to create and develop new ideas 
concerning physical  interfaces for collaborative interaction, or to vary
already  established ideas  in interesting ways.},

Davydov's theory suggests that the encapsulation may be overcome by teaching students theoretical and dialectical thinking, embodied in {\textquotedblleft}kernel concepts{\textquotedblright} of the given curricular subject, seen as powerful cognitive tools that transcend the boundaries of school learning. Lave and Wenger's theory suggests that the encapsulation may be overcome by engaging students in genuine communities of practice either outside school or transplanted into the school. Finally, the theory of expansive learning suggests that the object of school learning should be radically widened, to include the context of criticism, the context of discovery, and the context of application of the given contents. The institutional boundaries of school will be transcended by creating networks of learning from below.},

A range of technical, spatial and social factors have been found to influence the appeal, acceptance and usage of such screens. As there are still a range of unsolved issues around digital screens, including display blindness and evaluation apprehension, we argue that when thinking about the design of next generation urban displays, it is important to not only focus on these digital screens. Instead, we propose also investigating other types of displays, including non-digital ones. We contribute to this evaluation of a wider range of public displays by presenting two case studies in which non-digital public visualisations of local data were deployed in urban communities. Based on the findings from these studies, we distinguish four affordances of non-digital public displays and describe the opportunities these reveal for the design of future urban displays.},

Yet despite numerous examples of this `urban labelling' phenomenon, we know surprisingly little about so-called smart cities, particularly in terms of what the label ideologically reveals as well as hides. Due to its lack of definitional precision, not to mention an underlying self-congratulatory tendency, the main thrust of this article is to provide a preliminary critical polemic against some of the more rhetorical aspects of smart cities. The primary focus is on the labelling process adopted by some designated smart cities, with a view to problematizing a range of elements that supposedly characterize this new urban form, as well as question some of the underlying assumptions/contradictions hidden within the concept. To aid this critique, the article explores to what extent labelled smart cities can be understood as a high-tech variation of the `entrepreneurial city', as well as speculates on some general principles which would make them more progressive and inclusive.},

Building on research on computer-supported reflective learning as well as persuasive technology, and inspired by the Quantified Self community, we present an approach to the design of tools supporting reflective learning at work by turning context information collected through sensors into learning content. The proposed approach has been implemented and evaluated with care staff in a care home and voluntary crisis workers. In both domains, tailored wearable sensors were designed and evaluated. The evaluations show that participants learned by reflecting on their work experiences based on their recorded context. The results highlight the potential of sensors to support learning from context data itself and outline lessons learned for the design of sensor-based capturing methods for reflective learning.},

@article{kashtan_outdoors_2013,
  title = {Outdoors {{Virtual Museum}}},
  abstract = {The information era is evident in the implementation of ICT (Information and Communication Technology) in schools. ICT may be used to collect information, organize it, store and share it, thereby mediating between students and world phenomena. On the verge of the 21st century we are witnessing the emergence of paperless schools, e.g. schools that utilize digital books, notebooks and virtual labs as a substitute for paper books, notebooks and physical labs. Accordingly, students deal mostly, not with the physical world, but rather with its representation. This creates a parallel world, rather than a merging of the two worlds: the virtual and the physical. This may be linked to the core notion of Vygotsky's cultural-historical activity theory, which states that individuals do not act directly within the environment, but rather artifacts mediate relationships with objects in the physical world {[}1]. Hence, tools, as well as ICT applications and the Internet itself, may serve as artifacts, which facilitate higher order skills and thus mediate learning in schools and beyond. Engestrom {[}2] argues against the separation between schooling and other learning experiences; he refers to it as the encapsulation of school learning. To overcome this encapsulation, he offers emphasis on the role of mediating artifacts in human cognition and learning. Environmental programs, being international in nature, may combine real-world experiences with ICT. According to Vygotsky's cultural-historical activity theory, educational design and evaluation, whether in-class or with relation to the virtual environment, should reflect cultural-historical aspects of human activity. Effects of these programs should include indicators measuring sustainable changes {[}3]. The project described herewith, "Outdoors Virtual Museum" was designed in the spirit of the cultural-historical activity theory. A section of the Tel Aviv coast (Israel), where Levinsky College of Education and Alterman High School are both located, includes a natural wild area with a sandstone ridge and a wetland with some vernal ponds. It is the habitat of several species of plants and animals, some rare and endangered. This region is planned to undergo massive development as part of the city plan high-rise buildings for housing, roads, shopping malls and entertainment quarters. The project goals are to promote an activist-ecological agenda and to facilitate authentic learning in a technology-rich environment. Hence, by highlighting the natural value of the area, we achieve enhanced awareness among students, all of which are Tel-Aviv residents. The project involves 7th grade students and college education students documenting the nature life of the environment and changes due to the development process planned by the municipality. College and High school students, together with an ecologist and their science and science education teachers, toured the area several times and designed 7 stations representing diverse ecological niches. The exact locations were pinpointed using Google Earth. Each stop was then visited once a month by a group of students, measuring temperature and shadowing, and taking photos of the area, and documenting animals and plants. Each location was accompanied by a website constructed for displaying information, including photos. Websites were constructed using Google Sites by the students and updated on a monthly basis. In each physical location a QR code was incorporated, allowing visitors to access information on the websites. This project tackles the encapsulation of school learning by using ICT tools to mediate between the environment and the students. The added value of the product is the exposure of data and information within the community, as the QR-codes in the real world are in open spaces. Allowing their scanning and entering the web pages by all community members.},

  abstract = {The development of online and virtual teaching and learning environments to augment formal face-to-face environments raises questions about the way the new communication and information technologies (CITs) are being incorporated into the on-campus environment. More importantly, this development challenges the meaning of the on-campus student learning experience. The new CITs require institutions, teachers and researchers to reconsider the relationship of the physical setting to the student learning experience. This paper highlights examples of recent developments of new learning environments which have been enhanced by the contribution of educational developers at several Australian universities. It also proposes a set of pedagogically informed principles to guide the development of on-campus teaching and learning environments which may feature the use of CITs.},

  title = {Learning {{Activities}} in a {{Sociable Smart City}}},
  abstract = {We present our approach on how smart city technologies may
enhance the learning process. We have developed the CLIO urban computing
system, which invites people to share personal memories and interact the
collective city memory. Various educational scenarios and activities were
performed exploiting CLIO; in this paper we present the methodology we
followed and the experience we gained. Learning has always been the cognitive
process of acquiring skills or knowledge, while teachers are often eager to
experiment with novel technological means and methods; our aim was to
explore the effect that urban computing could have to the learning process. We
applied our methodology in the city of Corfu inviting schools to engage their
students in learning through the collective city memory while exploiting urban
computing. Results from our experience demonstrate the potential of exploiting
urban computing in the learning process and the benefits of learning out of the
classroom.},

Our aims are to support the re-enactment of stories to audiences, and integration within real classroom environments. A six-month iterative design process, working with children and teachers in school, has produced the {\textquotedblleft}magic carpet{\textquotedblright}, an interface that uses pressure mats and video-tracked and barcoded physical props to navigate a story in KidPad. Reflecting on this process, we propose four guidelines for the design of tangible interfaces for the classroom. (1) Use physical size and shysical props to encourage collaboration. (2) Be aware of how different interfaces emphasize different actions. (3) Be aware that superficial changes to the design can produce very different physical interactions. (4) Focus on open low-tech technologies rather than (over) polished products.},
